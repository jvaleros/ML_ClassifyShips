# ML_ClassifyShips
## Description
 This project is part of a Machine Learning course at San Diego State University. The topic we chose was a Ship Classification.
## Dataset
 The dataset we are using is located at [Kaggle Ships in Satellite Imagery](https://www.kaggle.com/rhammell/ships-in-satellite-imagery). This dataset contains 4000 png files, with the same resolution. Moreover, to simplify processing, the dataset contains a JSON file with data and the ground truth labels for each image in the set.
## Machine Learning Models
### CNN
### Logistic Regression(LR)
Here is a summary of the performance of the LR model on this dataset:

| Accuracy | Average Error | Class 0 Precision | Class 1 Precision | Recall |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 0.88 | 0.407279 | 0.886389 | 0.861736 | 0.861736 |
